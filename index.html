                            <p class="info">India lies in south Asia, between Pakistan, China and Nepal. To the north it
                                is bordered
                                by the world’s highest mountain chain.

                                The capital of India is New Delhi, and the country largest cities are Mumbai (formerly
                                Bombay), Delhi, and Kolkata (formerly Calcutta).

                                India is the seventh largest country in the world.

                                India’s population is one billion making it the second most populous country after
                                China.

                                India is the largest democracy (Government by the people, like the UK is) in the world.

                                India is mainly an agricultural country, though it also has a large iron and steel
                                industry and produces every type of manufactured goods.

                                India is in Southern Asia, bordering the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, between
                                Burma and Pakistan.

                                India is a part of Asia, one of the five continents of the World. Its history begins
                                with the pre-Vedic period, but the written documents are available from the Vedic
                                period. The Vedas and Upanishads reveal many mysteries about India. Our ancient
                                scriptures say that India used to be the reserve of all the important and precious
                                natural resources.</p>

                                The northern area of Andhra Pradesh is mountainous. The highest peak Mahendragiri rises
                                1,500 m above the sea level. The climate is generally hot and humid. Annual rainfall is
                                125 cm. The Krishna and Godavari are the major rivers in the state.

                                Andhra Pradesh has a single-chamber Legislative Assembly of 175 seats. Till date, the

                                The state of Andhra Pradesh has been bifurcated and a state called Telangana has been
                                carved out of it. The Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 bill was passed in
                                February 2014, in favour of the formation of the state of Telangana, which comprise of
                                10 districts from north-western Andhra Pradesh. The new state came into existence from 2
                                June 2014 as the 29th state of India, after the President of India's approval.Hyderabad
                                was declared to remain the capital of both the states for ten years. However, the Andhra
                                Pradesh government proposed a new capital for the state in Vijaywada region.<br />
                                Andhra Pradesh is rich in historical monuments and many holy temples. Tirupati in the
                                Chittoor district houses one of the most famous temples in India. The presiding deity is
                                known as Venkateswara. The main temple is situated on a hill top, Tirumala, and is a

                                'Land of the Rising Sun'. A sparsely populated state of India, Arunachal Pradesh is
                                bordered on the south by Assam, on the west by Bhutan, on the north and northeast by
                                China, and on the east by Myanmar (formerly known as Burma). It covers an area of 83,743

                                aligned ridges that separate deep valleys and rise to the peaks of the Great Himalayas.

                                The main rivers of Arunachal Pradesh are the Brahmaputra, which is also known as the

                                Bhareli. The climate of the foothills is subtropical; in the mountains, temperatures
                                decrease rapidly with altitude. Rainfall averages between 2000 and 4000 mm (80 and 160
                                in) a year.

                                Arunachal Pradesh has a single-chamber Legislative Assembly, which has 60 seats. The

                                house) and two to the Lok Sabha (lower house). The state is divided into 20 districts.

                                in the eastern part of India. Area wise Bihar is the thirteenth largest state and the
                                third most populated state in India. The flora and fauna of this state is enriched by
                                the river Ganges that flows through Bihar before getting distributed in Bengal's deltoid
                                zone. Bihar also has a vast forest land that covers an area of 6,764 km2. This state is
                                linguistically potent too as several languages are spoken here, like Bhojpuri, Maithili,
                                Magahi, Bajjika and Angika. The capital city of Bihar is Patna which was earlier called
                                Pataliputra. Bihar became the epicenter of power, culture and learning under the rule of
                                some of the greatest emperors of India, namely Samudragupta, Chandragupta Maurya,
                                Vikramaditya and Asoka. It was also home to the two great centers of learning at that
                                time, Vikramshila and Nalanda University. Even today one can find several ancient
                                monuments all over Bihar which are a living proof of the state's 3,000 years old
                                history; these monuments are visited by millions and millions of tourists all over the
                                world. The Mahabodhi Temple located in this state has been declared as a heritage site

                            <p class="info2">On November 1, 2000, India gave birth to a new state called Chhattisgarh
                                which was carved out of Madhya Pradesh. The area of 135,191 square kilometres acquired
                                by Chhattisgarh accounts for only 30 percent of the total area of Madhya Pradesh.

                                The demand for the new state can be traced to a meeting of the Raipur district Congress
                                in 1924 when the idea of a separate entity of Chhattisgarh was mooted. The leaders who
                                took part in that meeting were of the view that the region of Chhattisgarh was
                                culturally and historically distinct from the rest of Madhya Pradesh.

                                Chitrakote Falls:
                                The Chitrakote Falls is one of the prime attractions situated in the district of Bastar
                                in Chhattisgarh. The waterfall has a length of almost 29 meters. The best thing about
                                this waterfall is that the colour of the water changes according to the change in
                                season.

                                Kanker:
                                Kanker is a true gem in the crown of Chhattisgarh. Kanker is a quaint little old town
                                that boasts of abundant natural beauty. The town happens to be almost thousand years
                                old. Travellers come from different parts of the country to see the enchanting forests,
                                cascading waterfalls and unending landscapes of this town. Kanker also has an ancient
                                palace that once belonged to the royal family of the state.

                                Bhoramdeo:
                                This is also known as the Khajuraho of Chhattisgarh due to its resemblance to the
                                masterpiece. Bhoramdeo temple is situated in the Kabirdham district of the state. The
                                temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and has some of the finest carved sculptures on its
                                exteriors.

                                Hot spring Known as Taat Pani:
                                Taat Pani is the popular hot spring in Chhattisgarh in the Sarguja district. This hot
                                spring is known to have medicinal properties and it flows continuously throughout the

                            <p class="info2">Mizoram is one of the seven sisters of Northeast India, bordered by Myanmar
                                (formerly known as Burma) to its east and south, Bangladesh to its west, and the states
                                of Manipur, Assam, and Tripura to its north.

                                Mizoram means 'Land of the Highlanders' and its local language is Mizo. The Mizo Hills,
                                which dominate the state's topography, rise to more than 2,000 m (6560 ft) near the
                                Myanmar border. Aizawl, the state capital, is 1,220 m (4000 ft) above sea level.\
                                An amalgam of the former North and South Lushai Hill districts, Mizoram is a land of
                                great natural beauty, an endless variety of landscape with rich flora and fauna,
                                clusters of whispering pines and quaint villages with houses on stilts.

                                The Tropic of Cancer runs through the heart of Mizoram, and hence, it has a pleasantly
                                temperate climate throughout the year. A land of steep hills and deep gorges, Mizoram's
                                highest peak 'The Blue Mountain' rises to a height of 2,165 metres. Important rivers
                                that flow through this hilly state are Tlawang, Sonai, Tuivawl, Kolodine and Kamaphuli.

                                Mizoram has a single-chamber Legislative Assembly of 40 seats. The state sends two
                                members to the Indian Parliament: one to the Rajya Sabha (Upper House) and one to the
                                Lok Sabha (Lower House). The state has eight districts.

                                Similar to other states, the government of Mizoram is also determined by the national
                                constitution. The state is head by the governor which is appointed by the president of
                                India. The state is further divided into a number of several administrative districts
                                which are headed by deputy commissioners.

                            <p class="info2">Tripura is one of the Northeastern seven sister states in India. In fact,
                                it is the 3rd smallest state of India and covers an area of 10,486 square km.

                                The state is surrounded by Bangladesh on its north, west and south. On its eastern side,
                                it is surrounded by the state of Mizoram and Assam. Agartala is the capital of this
                                state. As per the 2011 census, the population of the state is 36,71,032. It constitutes
                                around 0.3% of the total population of the country. The indigenous communities that are
                                known as ST (Scheduled Tribes) in India form 30% of the population in Tripura. The state
                                has 19 tribes, and it is an eco-friendly and pollution-free state.

                                The languages that are mainly spoken in this state are Kokborok and Bangla. This state
                                was ruled by the Tripuri dynasty for many centuries. It was considered as a princely
                                state at the time of the British rule. In the year 1949, it became a part of independent
                                India. The ethnic strife and conflict between the Bengali population and indigenous
                                people have led to scattered violence and tension since the integration of this state in
                                India. On the other hand, the institution of an independent tribal administrative
                                organisation and various strategies have calmed the situation. National Highway 44 is
                                the only main highway that connects this state with the rest of India.
